Metrics Framework for Zoom (AARRR)
Overview

This repository presents a hypothetical product analytics framework designed for Zoom, a high-growth SaaS company operating a freemium subscription model.

The project demonstrates how a Product Manager can move an organization from vanity metrics (e.g., total signups) to a decision-driving KPI system that tracks the full user lifecycle, identifies funnel leakage, and ties product initiatives directly to business outcomes.

The framework is built using Dave McClure’s AARRR (Pirate Metrics) model.

Problem Statement

As Zoom scaled rapidly, leadership faced three core challenges:

Lack of a unified metrics framework across the user lifecycle

Inability to diagnose funnel drop-offs with precision

Weak linkage between product initiatives and revenue impact

Without a structured KPI system, teams risked optimizing locally rather than driving sustained growth.

Objective

Design and implement a comprehensive metrics framework that:

Measures each stage of the user journey

Identifies actionable drop-off points

Enables data-driven product prioritization

Connects product usage to retention and revenue

Role & Scope

Role: Product Manager, Analytics (Hypothetical)
Scope:

Metrics definition and ownership

Funnel instrumentation

Business question framing

Insight → action mapping

Framework: AARRR Metrics
1. Acquisition — How do users find us?

Primary Metric

Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate
Measures acquisition quality, not just volume.

Secondary Metrics

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

Channel-specific growth rates

Key Business Questions

Are we attracting users who are willing to pay?

Which channels drive high-intent users?

2. Activation — Do users experience value early?

Primary Metric

Activation Rate
% of users who host or join their first call within 24 hours of signup.

Secondary Metrics

Time to First Call

Onboarding Completion Rate

Key Business Questions

Are users reaching the “aha” moment quickly?

Where does onboarding fail to convert intent into action?

3. Retention — Do users come back?

Primary Metric

Monthly Active Users (MAU)

Secondary Metrics

Monthly Churn Rate

Meetings per User per Month

Key Business Questions

Is Zoom becoming part of users’ workflows?

Are we retaining both free and paid users over time?

4. Referral — Do users promote the product?

Primary Metric

Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Secondary Metrics

Referral Rate

Referral-driven Signups

Key Business Questions

Are users satisfied enough to recommend Zoom?

Is word-of-mouth contributing to organic growth?

5. Revenue — How does the product make money?

Primary Metric

Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Secondary Metrics

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

Key Business Questions

Is revenue growth predictable and scalable?

Are upsells and expansions working?

Key Insights & Actions (Hypothetical)
Activation Insight

Onboarding Completion Rate: 85%

24-hour Activation Rate: 30%

Interpretation:
Users complete onboarding but fail to take the next meaningful action.

Action

Introduced a post-onboarding CTA:
“Host a 1-minute test meeting”

A/B tested against control

Impact

Activation Rate increased from 30% → 45%

Resulted in a 5% lift in 30-day retention

Revenue Insight

MRR growing, but ARPU flat

Free-to-Paid Conversion below benchmarks

Interpretation:
Users were hitting value but not being nudged to upgrade.

Action

Analyzed feature usage (e.g., breakout rooms, webinars)

Implemented usage-based in-app upgrade prompts

Impact

ARPU increased by 8%

Free-to-Paid Conversion lifted by 2 percentage points
