# Metrics Framework for Zoom (AARRR)

## What This Project Shows

This project is not about dashboards.

It shows how a Product Manager can use metrics to:
- Diagnose user behavior across the entire lifecycle
- Identify high-impact drop-off points
- Prioritize product initiatives using data, not intuition
- Tie product decisions directly to retention and revenue

The goal is simple: turn metrics from passive reporting into active decision-making.

## Company Context (Hypothetical)

**Company:** Zoom  
**Business Model:** Freemium SaaS (subscription-based)  
**Stage:** High-growth, post-product-market fit

As Zoom scaled rapidly, tracking top-line metrics like total signups was no longer sufficient. Teams needed a structured way to understand *how* users moved through the product and *why* they converted, retained, or churned.

---

## The Problem

Zoom faced a familiar scaling challenge:

- Signups were growing, but **conversion quality was unclear**
- Engagement metrics existed, but **funnel leakage was hard to pinpoint**
- Revenue was increasing, but **upsell and expansion signals were weak**

Without a unified metrics framework, teams risked optimizing activity instead of outcomes.

---

## Objective

Design a comprehensive metrics framework that:
- Covers the full user lifecycle
- Identifies where users activate, drop off, and convert
- Enables data-backed product prioritization
- Connects user behavior to business results

---

## Role & Scope

**Role:** Product Manager, Analytics (Hypothetical)

**Responsibilities:**
- Metrics definition and ownership
- Funnel design and lifecycle mapping
- Business question framing
- Insight → action translation

---

## Framework Overview: AARRR Metrics

The AARRR (Pirate Metrics) framework was selected to break down the user journey into five clear, measurable stages.

Each stage includes:
- A primary metric (decision-driving)
- Supporting metrics (diagnostic)
- The business questions they answer

---

## 1. Acquisition — How do users find us?

**Primary Metric**
- **Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate**  
  Measures acquisition *quality*, not just volume.

**Supporting Metrics**
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Channel-specific growth rates

**Key Questions**
- Are we attracting users who see enough value to pay?
- Which channels drive the highest-intent users?

---

## 2. Activation — Do users experience value early?

**Primary Metric**
- **Activation Rate**  
  % of users who host or join their first call within 24 hours of signup.

**Supporting Metrics**
- Time to First Call
- Onboarding Completion Rate

**Key Questions**
- Are users reaching the “aha” moment quickly?
- Where does onboarding fail to translate intent into action?

---

## 3. Retention — Do users come back?

**Primary Metric**
- **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**

**Supporting Metrics**
- Monthly churn rate
- Meetings per user per month

**Key Questions**
- Is Zoom becoming part of users’ workflows?
- Are we retaining both free and paid users over time?

---

## 4. Referral — Do users tell others?

**Primary Metric**
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**

**Supporting Metrics**
- Referral rate
- Referral-driven signups

**Key Questions**
- Are users satisfied enough to recommend Zoom?
- Is word-of-mouth contributing to sustainable growth?

---

## 5. Revenue — How does the product make money?

**Primary Metric**
- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**

**Supporting Metrics**
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

**Key Questions**
- Is revenue growth predictable and scalable?
- Are upsell and expansion motions effective?

---

## Key Insights & Actions (Hypothetical)

### Activation Insight

- Onboarding Completion Rate: **85%**
- 24-hour Activation Rate: **30%**

**Interpretation:**  
Users completed onboarding but did not immediately experience core product value.

**Action**
- Introduced a post-onboarding CTA:  
  *“Host a 1-minute test meeting”*
- Ran an A/B test against the existing flow

**Impact**
- Activation Rate increased from **30% → 45%**
- Resulted in a **5% lift in 30-day retention** for the cohort

---

### Revenue Insight

- MRR growing, but **ARPU flat**
- Free-to-Paid Conversion below benchmarks

**Interpretation:**  
Users were reaching value but lacked timely upgrade prompts.

**Action**
- Analyzed feature usage (e.g., breakout rooms, webinars)
- Implemented usage-based, in-app upgrade nudges

**Impact**
- ARPU increased by **8%**
- Free-to-Paid Conversion improved by **2 percentage points**

---

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates:
- Strong lifecycle thinking
- Clear metric ownership
- Ability to translate data into product decisions
- Understanding of freemium SaaS growth dynamics

This is a **decision framework**, not a reporting exercise.

---

## Limitations

- All metrics and results are hypothetical
- No real Zoom data was used
- Focus is on framework design and reasoning, not implementation

---

## Potential Extensions

- SQL-based funnel queries
- Cohort retention analysis
- Experiment design documentation
- Mock dashboards (Amplitude / Mixpanel / Looker)
